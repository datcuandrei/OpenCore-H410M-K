<b>Gathering macOS</b>
----------------------
Personally, I have used [Dortania's guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/mac-install.html#making-the-installer-in-macos) for downloading a macOS package, but you can also use [gibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS) if you encounter any issues.

**Note for Sonoma**: In case you are upgrading from Ventura to Sonoma and you are encountering boot loops when starting the macOS Installer, find your macOS Installer partition number in OpenCore EFI Shell and run:
```
\System\Library\CoreServices\boot.efi -v revpatch=sbvmm
```
On my system it worked without the patch. The `-v` is optional, but recommended for verbose outputting. It will make debugging easier.

Also, `SecureBootModel` is set to `Disabled` for Sonoma upgrade. If you want to enable it, use `j185` for `iMac20,1` SMBIOS.

<b>What's working</b>
---------------------
Everything works (except for AirDrop, Handoff, etc. since I don't have a BT adapter). All iCloud services, sleep, DRM and other normal anomalies on a Hackintosh work as it would on a real Mac.

<b>Post Installation</b>
------------------------
Make sure after you finished the installation to copy your EFI from the USB drive to your Hackintosh's EFI so you can boot without the use of the USB drive. If you have a hard time mounting the EFI partition, you can use [MountEFI](https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI). 

Also, update your SMBIOS, as this `config.plist` doesn't have a valid serial number on purpose. For this, use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS).

To edit `config.plist` in a graphical manner, you can use [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree). Otherwise, you need to know how XML formatting works (I personally use `vim`).
